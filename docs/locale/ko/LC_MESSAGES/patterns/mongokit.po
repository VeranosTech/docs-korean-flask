#~ msgid ""
#~ "Using a document database rather than"
#~ " a full DBMS gets more common "
#~ "these days. This pattern shows how "
#~ "to use MongoKit, a document mapper "
#~ "library, to integrate with MongoDB."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This pattern requires a running MongoDB"
#~ " server and the MongoKit library "
#~ "installed."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "There are two very common ways to"
#~ " use MongoKit.  I will outline each"
#~ " of them here:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Declarative"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "The default behavior of MongoKit is "
#~ "the declarative one that is based "
#~ "on common ideas from Django or the"
#~ " SQLAlchemy declarative extension."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Here an example :file:`app.py` module for your application::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "To define your models, just subclass "
#~ "the `Document` class that is imported"
#~ " from MongoKit.  If you've seen the"
#~ " SQLAlchemy pattern you may wonder "
#~ "why we do not have a session "
#~ "and even do not define a `init_db`"
#~ " function here.  On the one hand, "
#~ "MongoKit does not have something like"
#~ " a session.  This sometimes makes it"
#~ " more to type but also makes it"
#~ " blazingly fast.  On the other hand,"
#~ " MongoDB is schemaless.  This means "
#~ "you can modify the data structure "
#~ "from one insert query to the next"
#~ " without any problem.  MongoKit is "
#~ "just schemaless too, but implements some"
#~ " validation to ensure data integrity."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Here is an example document (put this also into :file:`app.py`, e.g.)::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "This example shows you how to "
#~ "define your schema (named structure), a"
#~ " validator for the maximum character "
#~ "length and uses a special MongoKit "
#~ "feature called `use_dot_notation`.  Per "
#~ "default MongoKit behaves like a python"
#~ " dictionary but with `use_dot_notation` set"
#~ " to ``True`` you can use your "
#~ "documents like you use models in "
#~ "nearly any other ORM by using dots"
#~ " to separate between attributes."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "You can insert entries into the database like this:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "Note that MongoKit is kinda strict "
#~ "with used column types, you must "
#~ "not use a common `str` type for"
#~ " either `name` or `email` but "
#~ "unicode."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "Querying is simple as well:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "PyMongo Compatibility Layer"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "If you just want to use PyMongo,"
#~ " you can do that with MongoKit "
#~ "as well.  You may use this process"
#~ " if you need the best performance "
#~ "to get.  Note that this example "
#~ "does not show how to couple it "
#~ "with Flask, see the above MongoKit "
#~ "code for examples::"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid ""
#~ "To insert data you can use the "
#~ "`insert` method.  We have to get a"
#~ " collection first, this is somewhat "
#~ "the same as a table in the "
#~ "SQL world."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "MongoKit will automatically commit for us."
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "To query your database, you use the collection directly:"
#~ msgstr ""

#~ msgid "These results are also dict-like objects:"
#~ msgstr ""
